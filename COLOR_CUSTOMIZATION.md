## Tips for Choosing Colors

### Contrast is Key
- Ensure high contrast between background and text
- Low contrast = hard to read, eye strain
- Test readability from your recording distance

### Consider Your Environment
- **Dark room**: Dark background with light text
- **Bright room**: Light background with dark text
- **Green screen**: Avoid green in your color scheme

### Brand Matching
- Use your company or personal brand colors
- Import hex codes from your brand guidelines
- Creates professional, cohesive look

### Lighting Conditions
- **Low light**: Darker backgrounds reduce glare
- **Bright light**: Higher contrast needed
- **Mixed lighting**: Test before recording

## How to Use Color Pickers

1. Click on a color picker box
2. A color selector will appear
3. Options:
   - Drag the main selector for hue
   - Adjust brightness/saturation
   - Or type hex code directly (e.g., #FF0000)
4. Color updates in real-time
5. Your choice is automatically saved

## Advanced Tips

### Copy Color Codes
If you have specific hex codes:
1. Click the color picker
2. Look for the hex input field (usually bottom)
3. Paste your hex code (e.g., #FF5733)

### Match Brand Colors
1. Find your brand's hex codes
2. Input them in the color pickers
3. Save as your go-to custom theme

### Eye Comfort
- Avoid pure white (#FFFFFF) on pure black (#000000) for long sessions
- Slightly off-white (#F0F0F0) and near-black (#0A0A0A) reduce eye strain
- Test colors before long recording sessions

### Accessibility
- Ensure WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Test with color blindness simulators if needed
- High contrast benefits everyone

## Automatic Color Calculations

When you choose custom colors, the app automatically generates:
- **Secondary Background**: Slightly lighter than main background (for controls)
- **Secondary Text**: Slightly dimmer than main text (for labels)
- **Border Colors**: Based on your background
- **Highlight Zones**: Transparent overlay using accent color

This ensures a cohesive look across the entire interface!

## Saving Your Colors

Your custom colors are automatically saved:
- Stored in browser localStorage
- Persist across sessions
- Reload page = colors still there

**Note**: Private/incognito mode won't save settings

## Switching Between Themes

You can switch between preset themes and custom anytime:
1. Click any preset theme button (Dark, Light, etc.)
2. Click Custom to return to your custom colors
3. Your custom colors are preserved even when using presets
